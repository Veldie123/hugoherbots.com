# HugoHerbots.ai — Brand Voice & Communication

## Hugo Herbots' Voice
Hugo Herbots is a Belgian sales trainer with 40 years of experience. His communication style:

- **Direct and no-nonsense** — No corporate fluff. Says what he means.
- **Warm but challenging** — He cares about your success, but won't sugarcoat feedback
- **Experience-based** — Every piece of advice comes from real sales situations, not theory
- **Dutch-speaking** — Primary language is Dutch (Belgian/Flemish), but works internationally
- **Signature quote**: "Want de laatste geboren verkoper is gisteren gestorven..." (Because the last born salesman died yesterday...)
- **Tone**: Like a mentor/coach, not a professor. Conversational, practical, actionable.

## Platform Language
- **UI language**: Dutch (Belgian market first)
- **Technical terms**: English where industry-standard (Dashboard, Settings, Roleplay)
- **Brand name**: Always "E.P.I.C." with dots after each letter (not "EPIC" or "E.P.I.C")
- **Naming convention**: "E.P.I.C. techniques" (lowercase t in navigation), "E.P.I.C. Techniques" (capital T in page titles)

## Design Language
- **Color scheme — User view**: Steel Blue (#4F7396) as primary accent. Clean, professional, trustworthy.
- **Color scheme — Admin view**: Purple (purple-500/600/700) for all accents. Clear distinction from user side.
- **Semantic colors**: Green for success, red for errors, orange for warnings — universal across both views.
- **Typography**: Clean, modern. Large readable titles (32px+), comfortable body text (16px).
- **Feel**: Premium but accessible. This is a $500/month product — every pixel should reflect that value.
- **Dark mode**: Fully supported with persistence.

## Marketing Tone
When writing marketing content for HugoHerbots.ai:
- Lead with outcomes, not features ("Master de Sales Cyclus" not "AI-powered coaching platform")
- Use Hugo's authority ("40 jaar sales trainer, nu jouw persoonlijke coach")
- Be specific about what's included (54 techniques, 700+ videos, live coaching)
- Avoid generic AI hype — this is about Hugo's methodology, not "AI magic"
- Target pain: sales teams that waste money on generic training that doesn't stick
- Emphasize personalization: AI adapts to YOUR sales conversations, YOUR industry, YOUR level

## Key Marketing Messages
1. "Train met Hugo" — The primary CTA. It's personal, it's about Hugo, not "the AI"
2. "Mijn methode: 4 fasen, 54 technieken" — Concrete, structured, credible
3. "De laatste geboren verkoper is gisteren gestorven" — Hugo's signature opening, pattern interrupt
4. "Sales is geen talent, het is een vak" — Core belief that drives the whole platform

## What NOT to Say
- Don't call it "just another AI chatbot"
- Don't make it sound like Hugo is being replaced by AI — he IS the AI (his voice, his avatar, his methodology)
- Don't use overly technical language in marketing (no "RAG", "embeddings", "vector search")
- Don't promise "instant results" — this is serious professional development
- Don't compare directly to competitors — position as unique category ("jouw persoonlijke sales coach")
