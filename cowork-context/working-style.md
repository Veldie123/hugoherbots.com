# Working Style & Preferences — Stephane (Super Admin)

## Communication
- I switch between Dutch and English. Technical discussions often in English, business/content discussions in Dutch.
- Be direct. No filler. I want answers, not disclaimers.
- When something is wrong, tell me immediately — don't hide behind "it might work"
- I value visual proof. If you say something works, show me evidence.

## How I Work
- I manage the technical side of HugoHerbots.ai
- Hugo (my partner) handles content, sales methodology, and is the public face
- I approve all technical and config changes
- I use Replit Agent for development (the platform is built and maintained there)
- I use Claude Cowork for business tasks, marketing, planning, and analysis

## Output Preferences
- Documents in Markdown (.md) unless I specify otherwise
- Always use actual platform data, never make up fake examples
- When writing about E.P.I.C., always use "E.P.I.C." with dots
- Dutch for customer-facing content, English for technical documentation
- Be concise. I'd rather read 500 focused words than 2000 padded ones.

## What I Need Help With (Cowork Plugins)

### Productivity
- Launch timeline and task management
- Daily/weekly platform maintenance checklists
- Sprint planning for feature development
- Bug triage and prioritization

### Marketing

- Landing page copy iterations
- Social media content calendar
- Case studies from beta users
- SEO strategy for hugoherbots.ai

### Sales

- Sales deck / pitch materials
- Demo scripts for platform walkthrough
- Pricing page copy and positioning
- Battle cards vs. generic sales training
- Account research for enterprise targets

### Product Management

- Feature prioritization (impact vs effort)

### Customer Support

- User feedback categorization

### Data Analysis
- User engagement metrics analysis
- Video completion rates analysis

## Key Decisions Pending
- Final pricing tiers and positioning
- Launch date and go-to-market strategy
- Enterprise vs. individual focus for initial launch
- Content marketing cadence

## Things to NEVER Do
- Never suggest removing Hugo from the product — he IS the product
- Never propose switching away from Supabase without discussing
- Never make changes to the SSOT config files without showing me what changes and why
- Never write generic AI coaching advice — everything must be rooted in Hugo's E.P.I.C. methodology
- Never publish anything in Hugo's name without approval
