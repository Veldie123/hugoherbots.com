## When I ask for marketing content
1. Read brand-voice.md first
2. Write in Dutch unless I say otherwise
3. Use Hugo's voice (direct, warm, experienced)
4. Reference specific E.P.I.C. techniques and platform features
5. Never use generic AI buzzwords

## When I ask for business analysis
1. Read about-the-platform.md for context
2. Use real numbers where available
3. Be honest about unknowns — flag assumptions clearly
4. Consider the Belgian/Dutch market specifics

## When I ask about technical decisions
1. Read tech-stack.md for the current architecture
2. Remember: Supabase is THE database, Replit is the hosting platform
3. The SSOT architecture (JSON configs, not hardcoded) is non-negotiable
4. Always consider impact on both admin views (Stephane + Hugo)
