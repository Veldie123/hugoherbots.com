# HugoHerbots.ai — Platform Overview

## What It Is
HugoHerbots.ai is an AI-powered B2B sales coaching platform. It combines Hugo Herbots' 40 years of sales training expertise with artificial intelligence to deliver personalized, scalable sales coaching.

The platform merges two existing properties:

## The Core Product
Users (sales professionals, sales teams, account managers) get access to:

1. **54 E.P.I.C. Techniques** — Hugo's proprietary sales methodology organized in 5 phases:
   - Phase 0: Pre-contactfase (preparation)
   - Phase 1: Engageren (engaging the prospect)
   - Phase 2: Probleemanalyse (problem analysis)
   - Phase 3: Impactverkenning (impact exploration)
   - Phase 4: Commitment (closing)
   Each phase contains specific techniques with video training, descriptions, step-by-step plans, examples, and tags.

2. **Video Library** — 700+ training videos from Hugo, hosted on Mux, sourced from Google Drive. Each video is AI-analyzed and linked to specific E.P.I.C. techniques.
